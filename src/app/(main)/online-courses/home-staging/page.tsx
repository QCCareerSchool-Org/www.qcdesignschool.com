              <QuestionAndAnswer heading="How much does a home stager typically earn?">
                <p>According to the Home Staging Institute, the average home stager salary is approximately <strong>$51,000 per year*</strong>. However, your actual income can vary depending on factors like your <strong>location, experience level, and the types of staging services you offer</strong>.</p>
                <p>If you hold a recognized certification—such as the <strong>International Staging and Redesign Professional&trade; (ISRP&trade;)</strong> designation from <strong>QC Design School</strong>—you'll be able to charge higher rates and attract more clients. As you gain experience, you can also increase your prices for consultations, full staging services, and add-on offerings like color consultations or furniture rentals.</p>

QC offers additional certifications in these areas to help you boost your earning potential.
