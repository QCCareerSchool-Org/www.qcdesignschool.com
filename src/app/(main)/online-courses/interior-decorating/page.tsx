              <QuestionAndAnswer heading="Interior decorator vs. an interior designer: what's the difference?">
                <p>If you're considering a career in design, it's essential to understand the key differences between an interior decorator and an interior designer.</p>
                <p>An interior decorator focuses on the visual appearance and ambiance of a space. Decorators work with color palettes, textiles, lighting, furniture, and accessories to enhance the aesthetic of homes or commercial environments. They do not typically make structural changes.</p>
                <p>In contrast, an interior designer will focus on the visual appeal of a space and may collaborate with architects and engineers to plan structural layouts. This means that interior designers often require knowledge of building codes and spatial planning. </p>
                <p>Whether you aspire to become an interior decorator or designer, QC Design School's online Interior {designRestricted ? 'Decorating' : 'Design'} course equips you with the skills and knowledge to build a successful, rewarding career. You'll master the elements and principles of design, color theory, textiles, furniture selection, and space planning to create stunning, functional interiors your clients will love.</p>
