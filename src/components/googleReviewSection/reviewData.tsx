The program was easy to follow on line and the documents and assignments were easy to navigate, download and submit. I found the topics taught were very relevant and interesting, there was not one unit that I didn't enjoy. Once you get started you can't wait to move on to the next course. I enjoyed this course so much that I enrolled in 2 more courses. Once I am finished those I will do another one. Thank you QC Design School",

The tutors were very knowledgeable and helpful! I love that I got to do it on my own pace and I wasn't rushed. Because of QC Design School, I am able to succeed in my own home staging business, and I continue to learn from them through their blog posts and social media ! I highly recommend checking out their courses.",

Even though I have graduated, I still remain in contact with them because they are so nice and helpful. The courses are very fun too! I originally just planned on taking Interior Decorating and Staging, but since I really liked the courses, I also took three more - Professional Organizing, Virtual Design, and Feng Shui.  QC Design School allows students to work at their own pace, and it gives plenty of time to complete each course.  Because of QC Design School, I have been able to advance in my interior decorating career.  Thank you QC!',
